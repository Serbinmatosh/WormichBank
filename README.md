# WormichBank
Bank System Project written in Java. Still a work in progress

Items needed for software to work:

1. Database (use the files in the SQL project package to create and populate your MySQL database and its tables)
2. Change the username and password in the controller class to your username and password for mySQl
3. Install "Roboto" and "Noto Sans Kannada" Fonts on your computer
4. Download the project into your IDE


After completing the Items mentioned above, do the following:

1. Run MainServer.java in the "main" project package
2. Run MainClient.java in the "main" project package

Once again, this project is not finished, and it will be updated in the future as it is being worked on. :)

Cheers,

Milos
